            <p>The purpose of this little website is rather simple. It's to inform people about motivation or the lack
                thereof. It doesn't matter if you're in need of assistance or not, understanding motivation as a whole
                is
                the real goal. We aim to provide information that will help you understand how it effects
                you, your brain, and your livelihood. This includes little tips that will help you achieve your goal in
                curing
                or at least improving your lack of motivation!
                So go ahead and go through this little website at your own pace, in any order that you prefer.</p>
