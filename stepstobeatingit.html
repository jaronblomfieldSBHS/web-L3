            <p>There are a number of things that we can do to increase our motivation. One way is to set clear goals.
                When we know what we want to achieve, it is easier to stay motivated. We can also break down our goals
                into smaller, more manageable steps. This will make them seem less daunting and more achievable.
                Something simple and fun you could do is to reward yourself. This will help you stay motivated and on
                track because you have something to look forward to. Making you happier in general.

            <p>Something like motivation is tricky to break down, it isn't a very simple thing. Curing the lack of
                motivation is an impossible task, it's something that will always return no matter what you do. But you
                shouldn't let this fact set you back or get you down. Feeling unmotivated is a natural thing, and what
                you should when it appears is to be positive. Because although you can't get rid of it, you can make it
                not overstay it's welcome!</p>
