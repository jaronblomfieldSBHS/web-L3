            <p>Not having the motivation to do things can really suck. There could be something you really want to do
                but can't get started, and the fact that you can't just bums you out more. But we've all been there
                before. Getting over this hurdle will be easy!</p>

            <p>Motivation is the driving force that compels us to act. It is the reason why we do the things we do.
                Motivation is important for a number of reasons. It helps us to achieve our goals, overcome challenges,
                be more productive, and feel more satisfied with our lives.
                When we are motivated, we are more likely to take action, persist in the face of setbacks, and achieve
                our goals. Motivation can also help us to overcome challenges and setbacks. When we are motivated, we
                are more likely to see challenges as opportunities for growth and learning. We are also more likely to
                persevere in the face of setbacks, knowing that our efforts will eventually pay off.
